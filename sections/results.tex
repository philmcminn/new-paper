\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section, you should relate your results
to each of your research questions, one by one.

Any more anecdotal observations, or anything you
observed in the course of answering your research
questions that you did not deliberately set out 
to investigate should be included
in a subsection at the end of this section, called
``Discussion''.
